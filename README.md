# budget

A collection of tools to compute the Spectral Energy Budget of a dry non-hydrostatic Atmosphere. 
This package is developed for application to numerical simulations on regional domains.
SEBA is implemented based on the formalism developed by Peng et al. (2015). The analysis supports 
data sampled on a regular (equally spaced in longitude and latitude) or Cartesian horizontal 
grids. The vertical grid should be on geometric heights.
